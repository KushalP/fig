Description
===========

Fig is a utility for dynamically assembling an environment from a set of packages. Shell commands can then be executed in that package, after which the environment goes away. The caller's environment is never affected.

If fig, an "environment" is just a set of environment variables. A "package" is a collection of files, plus some metadata describing how the environment should be modified when the package is included. For example, a package containing an executable might specify that its "bin" directory be appended to the PATH environment variable. A package containing a Java library might specify that its jar files should be added to the CLASSPATH. Etc.

Packages exist in two places: a "local" repository in the user's home directory, and a "remote" repository that is shared by a team. Fig will automatically download packages from the remote repository and install them in the local repository, when needed. In this sense, fig is a lot like other dependency management tools such as Apache Ivy and Debian APT. Unlike those tools, however, fig is meant to be lightweight, platform agnostic, and language agnostic.

Installation
============

Fig can be installed via rubygems. The gems are hosted at [Gemcutter](http://gemcutter.org), so you'll need to set that up first:

    $ gem install gemcutter
    $ gem tumble

Then you can install fig:

     $ gem install fig

Usage
=====

Fig recognizes the following options (not all are implemented yet):

### Flags ###

    -d, --debug   Print debug info
        --force   Download/install packages from remote repository, even if up-to-date
    -u, --update  Download/install packages from remote repository, if out-of-date
    -n, --no      Automatically answer "n" for any prompt (batch mode)
    -y, --yes     Automatically answer "y" for any prompt (batch mode)


### Environment Modifiers ###

The following otpions modify the environment generated by fig:

    -i, --include DESCRIPTOR  Include package in environment (recursive)
    -p, --append  VAR=VALUE   Append value to environment variable using platform-specific separator
    -s, --set     VAR=VALUE   Set environment variable

### Environment Commands ###

The following commands will be run in the environment created by fig:

    -b, --bash                Print bash commands so user's environment can be updated (usually used with 'eval')
    -g, --get     VARIABLE    Get value of environment variable
    -x, --execute DESCRIPTOR  Execute command associated with specified configuration

    -- COMMAND [ARGS...]      Execute arbitrary shell command

### Other Commands ###

Fig also supports the following options, which don't require a fig environment. Any modifiers will be ignored:

    -?, -h, --help   Display this help text
    --publish        Upload package to the remote repository (also installs in local repository)
    --publish-local  Install package in local repository only
    --list           List the packages installed in local repository   

Examples
========

Fig lets you modify environment variables three ways:

* From the command line
* From a ".fig" file in the current directory
* From packages loaded via one of the previous two methods

### Command Line ###

So to get started, let's trying defining an environment variable via the command line and executing a command in the newly created environment. We'll set the "GREETING" variable to "Hello", then run "echo $GREETING, World" to ensure that the variable was updated:

    $ fig -s GREETING=Hello -- echo "\$GREETING, World"
    Hello, World

(Note that you need to put a slash before the dollar sign, otherwise the shell will evaluate the environment variable before it ever gets to fig.)

Also note that when running fig, the original environment is never affected:

     $ echo $GREETING
     <nothing>

Fig also lets you append environment variables, using the system-specified path separator (e.g. colon on unix, semicolon on windows). This is useful for adding directories to the PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, etc. For example, let's create a "bin" directory, add a shell script to it, then include it in the PATH:

    $ mkdir bin
    $ echo "echo \$GREETING, World" > bin/hello
    $ chmod +x bin/hello
    $ fig -s GREETING=Hello -p bin -- hello
    Hello, World

### Fig Files ###

You can also specify environment modifiers in files. Fig looks for a file called ".fig" in the current directory, and automatically processes it. So we can implement the previous example by creating a ".fig" file that looks like:
        
    config default
      set GREETING=Hello
      append PATH=@/bin
    end
    
The '@' symbol represents the directory that the ".fig" file is in (this doesn't matter now, but will become important later when we publish our project to the shared repository). Then we can just run:

    $ fig -- hello
    Hello, World

A single fig file can have multiple configurations:

    config default 
      set GREETING=Hello
      append PATH=@/bin
    end

    config french
      set GREETING=Bonjour
      append PATH=@/bin
    end

Configurations other than "default" can be specified using the "-c" option:

    $ fig -c french -- hello
    Bonjour, World
     
### Packages ###

Now let's say we want to share our little script with the rest of the team by bundling it into a package. The first thing you'll need to do is specify the location of your remote repository by defining the FIG_REMOTE_URL environment variable. If you just want to play around with fig, you can have it point to localhost:

   $ export FIG_REMOTE_URL=ssh://localhost`pwd`/remote

Before we publish our package, we'll need to tell fig which files we want to include. We do this by using the "resource" statement in our ".fig" file:

    resource bin/hello

    config default...

Now we can share the package with the rest of the team by using the "--publish" option:

    $ fig --publish hello/1.0.0

The "hello/1.0.0" string represents the name of the package and the version number. Once the package has been published, we can include it in other environments by using the "-i" option (we'll use the "--no-file" option here, to tell fig not to parse the ".fig" file in the current directory):

    $ fig --no-file -i hello/1.0.0 -- hello
